## 2026-06-13 09:30 — PR #4: int4 g128 + untied int4 lm_head re-quant (~127 TPS weight floor) [IN PROGRESS — awaiting HF Job]

- **Branch:** `lawine/int4-g128-lmhead`
- **Student:** lawine
- **Status:** WIP — local evidence complete; **awaiting human approval of HF Job (GitHub issue #12)**
  before posting terminal SENPAI-RESULT with official a10g-small numbers. Held at the int4 (PR #3)
  rung deliberately: the ladder is confirmed bottom-up and, per BASELINE.md, local A10G numbers are
  exploratory only — no merge to a confirmed TPS rung without the official a10g-small score.
- **Hypothesis:** Re-quantizing the QAT base (`gemma-4-E4B-it-qat-q4_0-unquantized`) to group_size=128
  across all 343 body modules plus an **untied int4 `lm_head`** (`embed_tokens` kept bf16) hits the
  int4-Marlin Ampere **weight-byte floor**, lifting single-stream TPS from the ~95 int4 base to ~127
  with PPL essentially unchanged (~2.02). This is the last "fewer weight-bytes/token" lever before
  sub-4-bit (a confirmed sm_86 dead end).

### Local Results (exploratory, A10G — NOT official a10g-small)

| metric | value | gate | pass? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Local PPL (served, 128/128 GT records, 61797 tokens) | **2.0190** | ≤ 2.42 | ✓ |
| Offline fake-quant PPL | 2.0197 | ≤ 2.42 | ✓ |
| Local TPS (exploratory, A10G, single-stream) | **127.99** | — | on target ~126.8 (+33% over int4 base ~96) |
| Greedy identity (official served-vs-served, standard cap=512 config) | **GREEDY_IDENTICAL** 128/128 prompts, 16384/16384 tok, 0 divergent | byte-exact | ✓ |
| Quantized modules | 343 body @ g128 + untied int4 lm_head = 344 total, 9.62 GiB on disk | — | ✓ |
| compressed_tensors version | 0.15.0.1 (vLLM 0.22.0's shipped version) | — | ✓ (see note) |
| All modalities | vision/audio loaded | — | ✓ |
| W&B run | `0pxj6n63` (`wandb-applied-ai-team/senpai-v1`, finished) | — | ✓ corroborates tps 127.99 / ppl 2.019 / GREEDY_IDENTICAL, logged verbatim |

### Key points

- **TPS lever:** 127.99 local = +33% over the int4 base (~96 local) and +0.9% above the ~126.8 public
  ladder target — confirms the int4-Marlin weight-byte floor on Ampere. group_size 128 + untied int4
  `lm_head` is the last weight-bytes/token reduction available (sub-4-bit AWQ/GPTQ/etc. have no
  loadable sm_86 kernel in vLLM 0.22 — confirmed dead end in BASELINE.md). lawine's track is at its
  natural floor; the next lever above this rung is the drafter (kanna #5 / land #9), not more quant.
- **Greedy identity (same resolution as stark's PR #3):** the official gate is served-vs-served at a
  SHARED config. lawine proved **GREEDY_IDENTICAL 128/128 at the standard cap=512 config**; spurious
  divergence only appears under cross-config (no-cap reference vs cap=512 candidate). Not a blocker.
- **Version note:** the PR body states compressed_tensors==0.10.2 but lawine actually built against
  **0.15.0.1** — the version vLLM 0.22.0 ships. 0.15.0.1 is the correct/required choice; 0.10.2 is
  incompatible with vLLM 0.22.0. Acknowledged on the PR; the built checkpoint is the valid artifact.
- **PPL-metric note (reusable):** the scored gate metric is the token-weighted `served_ppl=2.0190`
  (`exp(Σnll/Σtok)` over all 61,797 tokens). The W&B run also logs an unweighted per-record mean
  `served_mean_record_ppl=2.1787`, which runs higher because short records weigh equally — it is
  informational only, not the contract metric, and both are under the 2.42 gate.

### Next Steps

- Human approves GitHub issue #12 → lawine runs
  `python train.py --submission submissions/int4_g128_lmhead --name int4-g128-lmhead --launch --wait`
- Official a10g-small TPS/PPL confirmed → lawine posts terminal SENPAI-RESULT to PR #4
- Advisor merges PR #4 → updates ladder (int4 g128/lmhead weight-floor rung officially confirmed, ~127)
- lawine's weight-quant track is then complete → pivot lawine to a fresh frontier lever next round

## 2026-06-13 09:00 — PR #3: Reproduce int4 QAT W4A16 leader (~95 TPS) [IN PROGRESS — awaiting HF Job]

- **Branch:** `stark/int4-qat-w4a16`
- **Student:** stark
- **Status:** WIP — local evidence complete; awaiting human approval of HF Job (GitHub issue #11)
  before posting terminal SENPAI-RESULT with official a10g-small numbers.
- **Hypothesis:** Stock vLLM 0.22.0 Marlin int4 W4A16 endpoint on `google/gemma-4-E4B-it-qat-w4a16-ct`
  reproduces the ~95.4 TPS / PPL ~2.01 VALID leader. The dominant lever: int4 weight quantization
  reduces bandwidth by ~4×, lifting TPS from 44 → ~95 with better PPL (QAT-trained).

### Local Results (exploratory, A10G — NOT official a10g-small)

| metric | value | gate | pass? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Local PPL (128/128 GT records) | **2.0055** | ≤ 2.42 | ✓ |
| Local TPS (exploratory, A10G, 32 prompts) | **95.99** | — | on target ~95.4 |
| Marlin kernel | `MarlinLinearKernel for CompressedTensorsWNA16` | — | ✓ confirmed |
| All modalities | vision/audio encoder cache initialized | — | ✓ |
| CUDA graphs | `FULL_AND_PIECEWISE`, no eager fallback | — | ✓ |
| Peak GPU memory | ~21.1 GiB / 23 GiB | — | no OOM |
| W&B run | none (serving task, no training) | — | — |

### Key Finding — Greedy-Identity Nondeterminism

stark discovered that the int4+vLLM endpoint is **run-to-run nondeterministic** for greedy decode
at output_len=512: Marlin split-K GEMM / Triton-attn FP non-associativity introduces ~1 ULP noise
at near-tie logit positions, cascading to token-flip divergences at a handful of hotspots (idx 83,
104 consistently). Cross-path comparison (HF bf16 dense GEMM vs vLLM Marlin int4) always diverges
— different arithmetic paths.

**Advisor ruling:** NOT a blocker. The as-is stock int4 Marlin leader (~95.4 TPS, same stack) is
VALID on the official leaderboard. This submission IS that stack. Within-stack greedy identity
(same vLLM endpoint, same job run) is consistent; the official harness compares decode_outputs.jsonl
generated from the same serving instance. Determinism study deferred — not needed for this rung.

### Next Steps

- Human approves GitHub issue #11 → stark runs `python train.py --submission submissions/int4_qat --name int4-qat --launch --wait`
- Official a10g-small TPS/PPL confirmed → stark posts terminal SENPAI-RESULT to PR #3
- Advisor merges PR #3 → updates ladder (int4 rung officially confirmed)

## 2026-06-13 08:40 — PR #2: Resolve PPL artifact path + validate bf16 baseline locally

- **Branch:** `fern/vllm-baseline-ppl-resolution`
- **Student:** fern
- **Hypothesis:** Before spending HF Jobs quota on speed work, definitively explain why the prior
  bf16 smoke job (`6a2c5fb77c68f455eff14260`) produced `tps=44.018` but no confirmed
  `ppl_summary.json`. Prove the PPL and decode contracts against a local endpoint, deliver a
  reusable one-command local pre-validation harness, and confirm the `MAX_NUM_BATCHED_TOKENS=512`
  OOM-safety hypothesis on the longest GT context (2431 tokens). Research priority #1.

### Results

| metric | value | gate | pass? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Local PPL (128/128 GT records) | **2.3012** | ≤ 2.42 | ✓ |
| GT records completed | 128/128 | 128/128 | ✓ |
| PPL contract (`prompt_logprobs` on integer-ID prompt) | proven | — | ✓ |
| Decode contract (`choices[0].token_ids` len 512) | proven | — | ✓ |
| OOM safety (longest ctx=2431 tokens at `MAX_NUM_BATCHED_TOKENS=512`) | +560 MiB transient (< 0.5 GiB budget) | no OOM | ✓ |
| Root cause of missing artifact | 40-min HF Job timeout | — | identified |
| W&B run | none (local validation task) | — | — |

### Root Cause — Definitive

The 40-min HF Job wall-clock cap killed the job before PPL ever started. Timeline:

| stage | duration | cumulative | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cold startup (model load + torch.compile + CUDA-graph capture) | 11.9 min | 11.9 min | completed |
| Benchmark stage (128 prompts, decode, tps measurement) | 24.8 min | 36.7 min | completed |
| Decode capture (same 128×512 workload) | ~24.8 min est. | 61.5 min | **killed @ 40 min** |
| PPL stage (runs *after* decode) | n/a | n/a | **never reached** |

Evidence from preserved artifacts (`research/local_validation/prior_job_6a2c5fb77c68f455eff14260/`):
- `job_status.json` → `status:timed_out`, `stage:RUNNING`, `timeout_minutes:40` → rules out OOM (clean wall-clock stop)
- `run_environment.json` → `ppl.enabled:true` → rules out disabled
- `summary.json` → `duration_s:1488.8` (benchmark alone = 24.8 min) → rules out unfetched

**Implication:** at 44 TPS the bf16 baseline cannot fit startup+benchmark+decode+PPL in 40 min. All
faster submissions (≥95 TPS) will fit comfortably. The local harness (below) provides a timeout-free
gate.

### OOM-Safety Confirmation

Longest GT record (`gpqa_diamond-1d37a7a51d`, ctx=2431, tgt=512, combined=2943 tokens): HTTP 200 +
valid `prompt_logprobs` (len 2943). Peak GPU: 21009 MiB (+560 MiB transient). Theoretical chunked
bound: 512 positions × 262,144 vocab × 4B = 0.50 GiB. Confirms `MAX_NUM_BATCHED_TOKENS=512`
chunked prefill bounds the `log_softmax` peak as predicted in DATASET_ANALYSIS.md.

### New Shared Infrastructure

`scripts/local_prevalidate.py` — one-command local pre-validation gate:
```bash
cd target/ && VLLM_USE_FLASHINFER_SAMPLER=0 \
  python scripts/local_prevalidate.py --submission submissions/vllm_baseline --decode-num-prompts 16
# → SENPAI-LOCAL tps=44.0056 ppl=2.3012 completed=128
```

**All students should run this against their submission before opening an HF Job approval issue.**

### Local-Environment Note

FlashInfer JIT is broken on this node (CUDA 13.2 nvcc vs. vendored libcudacxx). Workaround:
`VLLM_USE_FLASHINFER_SAMPLER=0`. Numerically identical for greedy decode (argmax) and PPL
(logits/log_softmax). Not needed on official a10g-small image.

### Analysis & Conclusions

**Verdict: merge (infra + priority-1 resolution).** Not a TPS improvement but delivers essential
shared infrastructure and closes the highest-priority uncertainty blocking all future submissions.

- The bf16 baseline is correct: PPL ≈ 2.30 exactly matches the reference. The prior smoke job was
  not defective — it just ran out of time.
- The local pre-validation harness (`scripts/local_prevalidate.py`) is now a team-wide gate. Every
  student should PPL-validate locally before requesting an HF Job.
- The OOM-safety analysis confirms DATASET_ANALYSIS.md's `MAX_NUM_BATCHED_TOKENS=512` recipe is
  correct; the longest GT context (2431 tokens) fits within the GPU memory budget.
- The 40-min timeout root cause is important baseline knowledge: the benchmark + decode stages
  together consume ~24.8 + 24.8 = ~49.6 min at 44 TPS, plus ~12 min cold startup ≈ 61.5 min
  total. Any future a10g-small bf16 confirmation needs the timeout cap raised, or the decode
  prompt count reduced. Fast submissions (≥95 TPS) automatically fit in 40 min.

### Suggested follow-up (fern's own note, endorsed)

- Wire `local_prevalidate.py` into the pre-submission checklist (all students: run it locally;
  only request an HF Job once it passes). ← **Done — see "New Shared Infrastructure" above.**
- For an a10g-small bf16 confirmation, fern will open a separate `Approval request: HF job for
  vllm-baseline` issue — not done in this PR (local-only by instruction).
